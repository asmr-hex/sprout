# Questions
* whats with the suffixes for a lot of these modem models? e.g. `ACxxxx`, `MGxxxx`, `MB-xxxx`, `CR-xxx`, `SB-xxxx`?
  * it looks like the dashes don't matter in the naming scheme. e.g., `SB-6141 == SB6141`.

# challenges
* "Please keep in mind your ISP (Internet Service Provider) could be blocking certain ports such as port 80, 25 and 21. You can call and ask if they are blocking these ports inbound. If you are still not able to see the ports check the firewall and anti-virus software on your computer."
